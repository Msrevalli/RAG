      "An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\n",

      "The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n",
      "• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\n",
      "and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\n",
      "position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\n",
      "typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n",
      "[38, 2, 9].\n",
      "• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\n",
      "and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\n",
      "encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\n",
      "encoder.\n",
      "• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\n",
      "all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\n",
      "information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\n",
      "inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\n",
      "of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",
      "3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n",
      "In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\n",
      "connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\n",
      "consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n",
      "FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\n",
      "While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\n",

      "The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\n",
      "dff = 2048.\n",
      "3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n",
      "Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\n",
      "tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\n",
      "mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\n",

      "Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\n",
      "order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\n",
      "tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\n",
      "bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\n",
      "as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\n",

      "In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n",
      "P E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\n",
      "P E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\n",
      "where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\n",
      "corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\n",
      "chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\n",

      "P Epos.\n",
      "We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\n",
      "versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\n",

      "layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\n",
      "consider three desiderata.\n",
      "One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\n",
      "be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
      "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\n",
      "dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\n",
      "ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\n",
      "traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\n",
      "and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\n",
      "the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\n",
      "different layer types.\n",
      "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\n",
      "executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\n",
      "computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n",
      "6\n",
      "length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\n",
      "sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n",
      "[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\n",
      "very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\n",
      "the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\n",
      "path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n",
      "A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\n",
      "positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\n",
      "or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\n",
      "between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\n",
      "recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\n",
      "considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\n",
      "convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\n",

      " The table you've provided seems to contain configurations for different machine learning models, likely used in training neural networks. Let's break down the values and extract some insights from it:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Key Variables**: \n",
      "   - **N** seems to represent the number of layers or network depth.\n",
      "   - **d** might refer to dimensions, likely of model components such as embeddings.\n",
      "   - **h** could indicate the number of attention heads in a transformer model.\n",
      "   - **P** might denote some hyperparameter, potentially dropout probability.\n",
      "   - **ϵ** could be a small constant for numerical stability or another hyperparameter.\n",
      "   - **model** column might suggest different configurations or types of models being trained.\n",
      "   - **ff** may refer to feedforward network dimensions.\n",
      "   - **k, v, drop, ls** likely are specific model parameters, potentially for attention mechanisms.\n",
      "   - **steps** could refer to the number of training steps or iterations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Model Configurations**:\n",
      "   - There appear to be several distinct configurations, each with different combinations of these key variables.\n",
      "   - The first complete row after the headers seems to describe a model with 6 layers, a hidden size (d) of 512, a feedforward size (ff) of 2048, and an 8-head attention mechanism. It also notes dropout parameters of 0.1 and steps of 100K, which suggests these models were trained for 100,000 iterations.\n",
      "   - Another configuration indicates 6 layers, a hidden size of 1024, and a feedforward network size of 4096 with 16 attention heads, a dropout of 0.3, and training steps of 300K.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Trends and Comparisons**:\n",
      "   - It appears that the configurations vary primarily in the number of layers (N), dimension sizes (d, ff), attention heads (h), and training steps.\n",
      "   - There's a notable use of a high feedforward network size in larger configurations (2048 and 4096), which suggests emphasis on processing capacity or complexity in those models.\n",
      "   - There is an increased number of training steps as the models grow larger, indicating a need to train more thoroughly with added complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Additional Insights**:\n",
      "   - Dropout probabilities (P) and small constants (ϵ) might be adjusted to cope with the depth and complexity of each model, as seen with varying values (0.0, 0.1, 0.2).\n",
      "   - The phrase \"positionalembeddinginsteadofsinusoids\" suggests that an alternative method for representing position in input was tested, which could relate to model optimization practices.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Predominance of WSJonly, Discriminative Training**: The most frequent training method listed is \"WSJonly, discriminative,\" which appears five times. This suggests a strong emphasis on using discriminative training methodologies, specifically applied to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) dataset. It indicates that a significant portion of the research or application involves training models on this specific dataset using discriminative techniques, which focus on modeling the decision boundary between classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use of Semi-supervised Training**: The next most common method is \"semi-supervised,\" mentioned five times. This shows an interest or necessity in leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, likely to enhance the model's learning capacity without requiring an extensive amount of labeled data. Semi-supervised methods can be valuable in situations where labeled data is scarce or expensive to acquire.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Exploration of Multi-task and Generative Training**: The last two methods listed are \"multi-task\" and \"generative,\" each mentioned once. Multi-task learning indicates an approach where a model is trained on multiple related tasks simultaneously, potentially benefiting from shared representations. Generative training implies that models are possibly generating data or working within frameworks that involve probability distributions over datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the table illustrates a diverse approach to training models, with a strong focus on WSJ-specific discriminative methods, a significant interest in semi-supervised approaches, and some exploratory efforts in multi-task and generative training techniques. This diversity indicates a comprehensive exploration of different methodologies to potentially improve model performance and adaptability.\n",

      " The table you provided seems to be a text or data snippet that is not immediately coherent, as some parts of the text appear to be jumbled, inverted, or incomplete. However, I can attempt to derive some insights based on recognizable patterns and words. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Interpretation Hints**:\n",
      "   - The text contains reversed words. For more clarity, you should reverse these words back to their normal form to understand the content better.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Content Analysis**:\n",
      "   - Themes of Imperfection: The phrase suggests a recognition that applications (possibly laws or rules) are never perfect but should still be fair and just. This implies a critical discussion around the nature of laws/regulations.\n",
      "   - Opinion and Absence: The text expresses an opinion on missing elements (\"this is what we are missing\"), perhaps implying a gap between current law/regulation and what ideally should be present.\n",
      "   - Applications/Reviews: Words like \"application,\" \"review,\" and \"solution\" are scattered throughout, suggesting a focus on processes or solutions being applied and the need to evaluate or improve them.\n",
      "    \n",
      "3. **Structural Elements**:\n",
      "   - The appearance of \">SOE< >dap<,\" \"ure,\" and \"latt\" are unclear in the current form but could refer to abbreviations or specific terms that need context.\n",
      "   - The text also mentions attention, data analysis, and the need for a solution or resolution, emphasizing operational or evaluative processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Overall Theme**: \n",
      "   - This table seems to revolve around governance, laws, and the overarching opinion that while no law or application is flawless, they should strive for fairness and justice. It hints at a discussion around the practicality and fairness of certain rules or applications and possibly their evaluations or reviews. \n",

      "The images you've provided appear to be related to neural network architectures, possibly from a research paper or educational resource focused on attention mechanisms or transformers. Let me break down the key components and insights from these descriptions:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Image 1:**\n",
      "- **Components Described:**\n",
      "  - **Add & Norm:** These are likely referring to the addition and normalization layers commonly found in transformer models. They involve adding the input to the output of a previous layer and then normalizing the result, usually with layer normalization.\n",
      "  - **Feed Forward:** This refers to the feed-forward neural network layer that processes the embeddings independently in transformer models.\n",
      "  - **Multi-Head Attention:** This is a core part of the transformer architecture, which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.\n",
      "  - **Masked Multi-Head Attention:** In the context of transformer models (like those used in language modeling), this allows the model to focus on certain parts of the input while masking out others, often used in decoder layers to prevent attending to future tokens.\n",
      "  - **Nx | Gada. Norm:** This likely suggests repeated applications of the \"Add & Norm\" layers or blocks in a stack (denoted by \"Nx\"), though \"Gada. Norm\" might be a typographical issue.\n",
      "  - **Positional Encoding:** This adds information about the position of each token in the sequence, since transformer architectures don't inherently process sequential data in order.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Architecture Insights:**\n",
      "  - The structure seems consistent with a transformer model, which is prominent in natural language processing tasks. Key elements like multi-head attention and feed-forward layers are highlighted.\n",
      "  - The use of \"masked\" attention implies the presence of a language model component, where future tokens are masked during training in the decoder.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Image 3:**\n",
      "- **Components Described:**\n",
      "  - **Linear:** Likely refers to linear transformation layers which are used throughout neural networks to project data into different dimensions.\n",
      "  - **Scaled Dot-Product Attention:** This is the mechanism that underpins attention in transformers. It calculates attention scores between queries (Q) and keys (K), and is scaled by the dimension of the keys.\n",
      "  - **Y and Y terms:** While their meaning is unclear without more context, they likely relate to different computations or outputs at this stage of the architecture.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Architecture Insights:**\n",
      "  - The presence of scaled dot-product attention confirms that the discussion revolves around transformer-based architectures.\n",
      "  - This mechanism, combined with multi-head attention, allows for highly flexible and context-sensitive computations which are crucial in understanding dependencies in sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Insights:**\n",
      "- The information provided corresponds closely to transformers, which are powerful neural network architectures for tasks relying heavily on sequential data, such as language processing, translation, and time-series forecasting.\n",
      "- The images convey the sequential processing layers of a transformer, emphasizing attention mechanisms which are crucial for capturing context and dependencies within data.\n",
      "- This type of architecture is the foundation for many advanced AI models today, including models like BERT, GPT, and various others utilized in NLP tasks.\n",
      "Based on the provided tables and the extracted data, here are the key insights:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Model Configuration (Page 9, Table 1)**:\n",
      "   - Several models with different architectures have been tested.\n",
      "   - Configurations vary by factors such as hidden layers, training steps, drop-out rates, and positional embeddings.\n",
      "   - The configurations include various transformer architectures with different numbers of layers, hidden dimensions, and feed-forward dimensions. Dropout rates of 0.0 to 0.3 are used, with steps ranging from 100K to 300K.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Training Approaches (Page 10, Table 1)**:\n",
      "   - Focus tends to be on discriminative training methods using the WSJ (Wall Street Journal) dataset.\n",
      "   - Semi-supervised and multi-task approaches are also considered, indicating a mix of supervised and unsupervised learning strategies.\n",
      "   - Generative methods are briefly noted, perhaps compared against discriminative models.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Textual Tables (Page 13-15)**:\n",
      "   - Several pages from 13 to 15 seem to contain disjointed or partially scrambled text. This could indicate issues with data extraction or encoding.\n",
      "   - However, there seems to be some attempt at repeated textual phrases, possibly indicating the content is likely related to layered or structured information, similar to encoding or a translation process in training model configurations (common in machine translation reports).\n",
      "  \n",
      "4. **Tables with Repeated Phrases (Page 14, Table 2)**:\n",
      "   - This appears to be text data that seems to have been transposed/backward or not accurately read. Phrases like \"the Law will never be perfect\" suggest possibly evaluating or critiquing legal context or framework, possibly as a casualty in NLP processing efforts.\n",
      "   - Use of symbols `>SOE<` and `>dap<` or similar suggests possible placeholder tokens or metadata associated with translations or text transformation tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Model Output or Task Examples (Page 15, Table 3)**:\n",
      "   - The dataset gives the impression of being a generated output from models or part of a language model task, with the emphasis on phrases and translations ( \"the Law,\" \"be perfect,\").\n",
      "   - These tables seem to convey tests or capture certain translations, examples from language models or text transcription tool. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these insights suggest experimentation with various model configurations focusing on natural language processing tasks, with possible specific applications or evaluations on legal or document metadata tasks. The presence of differently trained models and tasks highlights a comparative analysis effort, evaluating output quality across techniques.\n",

      "significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\n",
      "computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\n",

      "In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\n",
      "relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\n",
      "The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\n",
      "translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n",

      "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n",

      "3 Model Architecture\n",
      "Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\n",
      "Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\n",
      "of continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\n",
      "sequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n",
      "[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n",

      "connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\n",
      "respectively.\n",
      "3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n",
      "Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\n",
      "sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\n",
      "wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\n",
      "the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\n",
      "LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\n",
      "itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\n",
      "layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n",
      "Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\n",
      "sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\n",
      "attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\n",
      "around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\n",
      "sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\n",
      "masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\n",
      "predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n",
      "3.2 Attention\n",
      "An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\n",
      "where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n",

      " Multi-Head Attention\n",
      "Figure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\n",
      "attention layers running in parallel.\n",
      "of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\n",
      "query with the corresponding key.\n",
      "3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n",
      "We call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\n",
      "queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\n",
      "query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\n",
      "values.\n",
      "In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\n",
      "into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\n",
      "the matrix of outputs as:\n",
      "Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\n",
      "√dk\n",
      ")V (1)\n",
      "The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\n",
      "plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\n",
      "of 1√dk\n",
      ". Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\n",
      "a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\n",
      "much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\n",
      "matrix multiplication code.\n",
      "While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\n",
      "dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\n",
      "dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\n",
      "extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\n",
      ".\n",
      "3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n",
      "Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\n",
      "we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\n",
      "linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\n",
      "queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\n",
      "4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\n",
      "variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\n",

      "output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\n",
      "depicted in Figure 2.\n",

      "dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\n",
      "is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n",
      "3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n",
      "The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n",
      "• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\n",
      "and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\n",
      "position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\n",
      "typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n",

      "• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\n",
      "and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\n",
      "encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\n",
      "encoder.\n",
      "• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\n",

      "layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\n",
      "consider three desiderata.\n",
      "One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\n",
      "be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
      "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\n",
      "dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\n",
      "ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\n",
      "traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\n",
      "and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\n",
      "the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\n",
      "different layer types.\n",
      "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\n",
      "executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\n",
      "computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n",

      "very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\n",
      "the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\n",
      "path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n",
      "A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\n",

      "between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\n",
      "recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\n",
